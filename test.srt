00:10:02,335 --> 00:10:05,504
That's right.
Is that it, by any chance?

177
00:10:05,504 --> 00:10:08,174
People who gave up on their marriages
Who gave up on marriage and bought a condominium...

178
00:10:08,174 --> 00:10:10,643
I'm not giving up.

179
00:10:10,643 --> 00:10:13,646
I beg your pardon.
I'm selling it when I get married.

180
00:10:13,646 --> 00:10:16,315
Take good care of it, will you?
Yes, sir.

181
00:10:17,984 --> 00:10:19,986
Also...

182
00:10:19,986 --> 00:10:24,323
My bedroom is also my study.
It's off-limits.

183
00:10:24,323 --> 00:10:26,993
Yes, sir.
And your room.

184
00:10:26,993 --> 00:10:30,000
I'm not going in.
Yes, ma'am.

185
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:30,329
I'm not going in.
Yes, ma'am.

186
00:10:30,329 --> 00:10:32,498
Also...

187
00:10:32,498 --> 00:10:35,668
Tell your father about the baby.
Tell your father about the baby.

188
00:10:36,669 --> 00:10:39,338
If I knew I had an adult roommate.

189
00:10:39,338 --> 00:10:42,642
And your father.
It'll give you some peace of mind, right?

190
00:10:44,310 --> 00:10:47,980
After my checkup next month.
I'm going to tell you.

191
00:10:47,980 --> 00:10:50,816
Not "intend," but absolutely.

192
00:10:51,817 --> 00:10:53,986
Yes, sir.

193
00:11:24,984 --> 00:11:27,153
Sorry.

194
00:11:27,153 --> 00:11:30,000
I'm sorry I pushed you.

195
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:30,156
I'm sorry I pushed you.

196
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:43,169
Ah!

197
00:11:43,169 --> 00:11:45,638
It felt good.

198
00:11:47,640 --> 00:11:49,642
Yes sir

199
00:11:51,477 --> 00:11:53,646
Huh?

200
00:11:53,646 --> 00:11:56,315
I feel like I'm forgetting something...

201
00:11:57,817 --> 00:11:59,819
Ha!

202
00:11:59,819 --> 00:12:00,000
I wanted to see you.
So...

203
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:02,655
I wanted to see you.
So...

204
00:12:02,655 --> 00:12:05,324
"I applied for a transfer to Tokyo...

205
00:12:05,324 --> 00:12:08,828
So that kiss was from you?
From you?

206
00:12:08,828 --> 00:12:10,830
No...
No...

207
00:12:10,830 --> 00:12:14,166
From me?
You beat me to it.

208
00:12:15,501 --> 00:12:17,670
What do you mean?

209
00:12:18,671 --> 00:12:21,640
I mean...
Why did you kiss me? I just...

210
00:12:22,641 --> 00:12:24,643
Ahhh...

211
00:12:24,643 --> 00:12:27,146
(egg cracking)

212
00:12:31,984 --> 00:12:34,153
What are you doing?

213
00:12:34,153 --> 00:12:36,489
Good morning.

214
00:12:36,489 --> 00:12:38,491
Morning. - Morning.
Oh, sorry.

215
00:12:38,491 --> 00:12:40,493
I've taken the liberty of using it.

216
00:12:40,493 --> 00:12:43,329
(The rice cooker will inform you when the rice is done cooking.)

217
00:12:43,329 --> 00:12:46,332
What? You went shopping for this?
You went shopping for this?

218
00:12:46,332 --> 00:12:49,835
No, I had rice and miso here.
I found some vegetables.

219
00:12:49,835 --> 00:12:52,505
Oh...
I can do it in a minute.

220
00:12:52,505 --> 00:12:55,341
Just a moment, please.

221
00:12:58,811 --> 00:13:00,000
Amazing...

222
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:00,813
Amazing...

223
00:13:00,813 --> 00:13:03,816
It's not an ideal breakfast.
Oh...

224
00:13:04,817 --> 00:13:06,986
Go ahead.

225
00:13:12,992 --> 00:13:16,328
Bon appétit!
Bon appétit!

226
00:13:20,666 --> 00:13:23,502
This miso soup is so good!

227
00:13:25,337 --> 00:13:28,174
Yeah.
Hi. - Hi.

228
00:13:31,143 --> 00:13:33,312
Um...

229
00:13:33,312 --> 00:13:35,481
In exchange for letting me live here.

230
00:13:35,481 --> 00:13:37,983
I'll cook.

231
00:13:37,983 --> 00:13:40,653
It's okay.

232
00:13:40,653 --> 00:13:44,490
But you...
You have to take proper nutrition, right?

233
00:13:44,490 --> 00:13:48,661
Just think about yourself.
I eat out a lot.

234
00:13:48,661 --> 00:13:51,664
I only drink vegetable juice in the morning.
It's enough.

235
00:13:52,665 --> 00:13:55,501
You really don't cook anything.

236
00:13:55,501 --> 00:13:58,170
No... sometimes I do.

237
00:13:58,170 --> 00:14:00,000
Anyway.
In living together.

238
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:01,640
Anyway.
In living together.

239
00:14:01,640 --> 00:14:05,477
I think it's better if we make up for each other's shortcomings.
I think it's better to make up for each other's deficiencies.

240
00:14:05,477 --> 00:14:09,148
Of course, I'd rather have
Mr. Naruse is more than happy to fill in for me.

241
00:14:09,148 --> 00:14:11,483
I mean, there are far more of them.

242
00:14:11,483 --> 00:14:14,820
So let me at least make you some food.
Let me cook for you.

243
00:14:14,820 --> 00:14:17,656
You can make it for one person, or you can make it for two.
It's the same thing.

244
00:14:17,656 --> 00:14:20,826
If you want, I'm more used to two people.

245
00:14:23,662 --> 00:14:27,166
All right, all right.
You're in charge of the kitchen.

246
00:14:27,166 --> 00:14:29,335
But don't overdo it.

247
00:14:29,335 --> 00:14:30,000
If you're not feeling well.
Don't stand in the kitchen.

248
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:33,339
If you're not feeling well.
Don't stand in the kitchen.

249
00:14:33,339 --> 00:14:35,341
Yes, sir.

250
00:14:38,143 --> 00:14:41,146
I can do the shopping.
I can handle it on my own.

251
00:14:41,146 --> 00:14:43,649
Mirin and Mirin-like seasoning
mirin and mirin-like seasoning.

252
00:14:43,649 --> 00:14:45,651
You didn't understand.

253
00:14:45,651 --> 00:14:48,487
So.
I should just buy mirin, right?

254
00:14:48,487 --> 00:14:52,491
No. Mirin is too expensive.
Mirin style.

255
00:14:52,491 --> 00:14:56,328
I'm paying for it.
The higher one's fine.

256
00:14:56,328 --> 00:14:58,664
Oh... okay.

257
00:14:58,664 --> 00:15:00,000
Then I will.

258
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:01,000
Then I will.

259
00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:04,803
After all, the flavor is totally different.

260
00:15:05,804 --> 00:15:09,475
Oh, that's right. I make lunch every day.
I bring it with me.

261
00:15:09,475 --> 00:15:12,011
Shall I make one for you, too?
Shall I make one for you?

262
00:15:12,011 --> 00:15:15,147
No, thank you.
If you bring a lunch box...

263
00:15:15,147 --> 00:15:18,817
Who made it? I'm sure they'll ask.
"Who made this?

264
00:15:20,986 --> 00:15:24,323
Oh, for Motohashi and the part-timers.

265
00:15:24,323 --> 00:15:27,326
Don't tell anyone I live here.
Don't tell anyone.

266
00:15:27,326 --> 00:15:29,995
If they find out, there will be a lot of trouble.

267
00:15:29,995 --> 00:15:30,000
Yes, sir.

268
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:31,997
Yes, sir.

269
00:15:31,997 --> 00:15:34,667
Ah.
What?

270
00:15:34,667 --> 00:15:38,003
Have you already told someone?
No...

271
00:15:38,003 --> 00:15:40,506
I forgot to bring my lunch box.
I forgot.

272
00:15:40,506 --> 00:15:44,310
What? You scared me.
Then why don't you just buy it?

273
00:15:44,310 --> 00:15:46,812
No, I can't do that.
It's such a waste. I can't do it.

274
00:15:46,812 --> 00:15:48,981
I'll get it later.

275
00:15:48,981 --> 00:15:51,650
Oh, then...

276
00:15:51,650 --> 00:15:53,986
And while we're at it, why don't we take the desk with us?

277
00:15:53,986 --> 00:15:55,988
What? No...

278
00:15:55,988 --> 00:15:58,824
How did you get a desk?

279
00:16:00,826 --> 00:16:02,828
What?

280
00:16:15,341 --> 00:16:17,309
（Yo...

281
00:16:17,309 --> 00:16:19,645
Sorry to keep you waiting.
Not at all.

282
00:16:19,645 --> 00:16:21,647
I'm sorry I asked so much.
No, no, no.

283
00:16:21,647 --> 00:16:24,316
If Mr. Naruse asks me to do something...

284
00:16:24,316 --> 00:16:27,152
Um, about what we talked about on the phone earlier...
About what we talked about on the phone earlier...

285
00:16:27,152 --> 00:16:30,000
I understand.
I'm only working with Mr. Naruse personally.

286
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:31,156
I understand.
I'm only working with Mr. Naruse personally.

287
00:16:31,156 --> 00:16:35,661
I'll be sure to charge Mr. Naruse the full fee.
Mr. Naruse will be charged the full rate.

288
00:16:35,661 --> 00:16:38,497
Thank you very much.
Okay, I'll get right to it.

289
00:16:38,497 --> 00:16:40,666
It will be on the second floor.

290
00:16:42,334 --> 00:16:44,336
What?

291
00:16:46,005 --> 00:16:48,173
Why?
After my phone call with Mr. Naruse.

292
00:16:48,173 --> 00:16:50,309
Just when he
I've just caught him.

293
00:16:50,309 --> 00:16:53,812
Sorry I'm late.
Yeah, I just got here, too.

294
00:16:53,812 --> 00:16:55,814
Thank you.

295
00:16:55,814 --> 00:16:58,984
No, I...
Shall we do it?

296
00:17:00,986 --> 00:17:04,323
Um... I'm sorry about yesterday.

297
00:17:04,323 --> 00:17:06,992
Oh, no...

298
00:17:14,900 --> 00:17:16,902
(expression of) effort or strain

300
00:17:26,045 --> 00:17:28,047
Oh...

301
00:17:29,214 --> 00:17:30,000
Yes, ma'am.
（The floor. Careful on the floor.

302
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:31,550
Yes, ma'am.
（The floor. Careful on the floor.

303
00:17:31,550 --> 00:17:34,386
Okay. The one in the kitchen, right?

304
00:17:38,891 --> 00:17:40,893
There it is.

305
00:17:40,893 --> 00:17:43,562
Is there anything else you'd like to bring?

306
00:17:43,562 --> 00:17:46,065
Then it's in the same place.
（Ouch...

307
00:17:46,065 --> 00:17:48,901
☎ I'd also like a set of spoons and forks please.
what's wrong?

308
00:17:49,902 --> 00:17:51,904
Oh, a set?

309
00:17:51,904 --> 00:17:55,707
Okay. Bye.
Thank you.

311
00:18:13,058 --> 00:18:15,060

What?

Oh...

Yes...

Good...

320
00:18:49,228 --> 00:18:51,230
I'm sorry...
Let's go!

321
00:18:51,230 --> 00:18:53,232
Here we go.

322
00:18:53,232 --> 00:18:55,234
Are you okay?
Yeah, I'm fine.

323
00:18:55,234 --> 00:18:58,237
（Wow.
I'm glad Kase-kun came.

324
00:18:58,237 --> 00:19:00,000
This is pretty heavy, isn't it?

325
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:02,241
This is pretty heavy, isn't it?

326
00:19:02,241 --> 00:19:05,377
But your relative's daughter
That's great.

327
00:19:05,377 --> 00:19:08,213
What?
This study desk.

328
00:19:08,213 --> 00:19:10,883
You brought it from your parents' house, didn't you?

329
00:19:10,883 --> 00:19:14,219
My kids, too.
I used to use something similar.

330
00:19:14,219 --> 00:19:18,390
If you're going to stay in a room...
I'll buy you a new one.

331
00:19:18,390 --> 00:19:21,059
This is the kind of solid...

332
00:19:21,059 --> 00:19:25,230
It wasn't cheap.
Now it's just a piece of junk.

333
00:19:26,231 --> 00:19:28,734
You have a very devoted daughter.

334
00:19:28,734 --> 00:19:30,000
Oh...

335
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:30,736
Oh...

336
00:19:34,072 --> 00:19:36,542
Oh.
I'll take the back of that truck.

337
00:19:36,542 --> 00:19:38,544
(Driver) Yes.

338
00:19:40,546 --> 00:19:43,048
（This kind of thing.
How much do you think it costs?

339
00:19:43,048 --> 00:19:45,050
How much is it?

340
00:19:45,050 --> 00:19:48,220
Correct answer!
You can't put a price on memories.

341
00:19:48,220 --> 00:19:50,889
Shall we go?
（I'll close then.

342
00:19:50,889 --> 00:19:53,058
（Yes.

343
00:19:53,058 --> 00:19:56,061
Oh, um, me too.
May I get in?

344
00:19:56,061 --> 00:19:58,397
（Of course.
（This way then.

345
00:19:58,397 --> 00:20:00,000
Oh, wait a minute.
I'll be right back.

346
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:01,400
Oh, wait a minute.
I'll be right back.

347
00:20:07,906 --> 00:20:11,076
Hey, that truck...
That truck. Follow it, please.

00:22:14,399 --> 00:22:17,736
I'm sorry to barge in like this.
You just brought it in?

374
00:22:17,736 --> 00:22:19,705
It's my daughter's desk, right?

What?
I've been using it since elementary school.

379
00:22:30,215 --> 00:22:32,217
It's a study desk.

380

From the cab he was riding in.

388
00:23:10,389 --> 00:23:13,558
I just saw the desk in the truck.
I could see it.

389
00:23:13,558 --> 00:23:16,728
Mr. Naruse is here.

390
00:23:18,230 --> 00:23:21,400
No, of course not.
I've taken the liberty of following you here.

391

I don't think it's a good thing.
I don't think it's a good thing.

392

Well, but... as a parent...
I don't know what's going on. I'm just...

393
00:23:28,407 --> 00:23:30,000
Thank you. I'm sorry.

394
00:23:30,000 --> 00:23:31,076
Thank you. I'm sorry.

My daughter...

397
00:23:38,417 --> 00:23:41,586
I'm in good hands here.
Is that what you mean?

398
00:23:42,721 --> 00:23:47,726
Well... well, that's the way it is, isn't it?
Is that what I think it is?

399
00:23:50,395 --> 00:23:54,566
I mean, you're going to have to carry it to your desk in a short amount of time.
It's not a lot of time, is it?

400
00:23:54,566 --> 00:23:56,735
Is that...
What does that mean?

401
00:23:56,735 --> 00:23:59,905
I recently started working part-time for my daughter.
Her supervisor.

402
00:23:59,905 --> 00:24:00,000
Why do you do it?
Why do you do that?

Why do you do it?
Why do you do that?

404
00:24:03,575 --> 00:24:05,577
Dad...
You shut your mouth.

405
00:24:05,577 --> 00:24:08,413
I'm talking to Mr. Naruse right now.

406
00:24:08,413 --> 00:24:13,084
I am a parent, and I would like to know why.
I would like to know the reason why.

407
00:24:15,086 --> 00:24:17,923
I'm having a baby.
What?

408
00:24:21,560 --> 00:24:24,062
Oh...

409
00:24:24,062 --> 00:24:26,398
Well, congratulations on that.

410
00:24:29,067 --> 00:24:30,000
To me.

411
00:24:30,000 --> 00:24:31,236
To me.

412
00:24:35,574 --> 00:24:38,076
I...

413
00:24:41,079 --> 00:24:43,748
Pregnancy.

Scheduled on November 14.

415
00:24:51,389 --> 00:24:53,925
What are you talking about?

416
00:24:56,228 --> 00:24:58,396
In the belly.

417
00:24:58,396 --> 00:25:00,000
I have a baby.

418
00:25:00,000 --> 00:25:01,066
I have a baby.

419
00:25:04,903 --> 00:25:07,739
I'm sorry I didn't tell you before...

420
00:25:08,740 --> 00:25:11,076
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

421
00:25:23,555 --> 00:25:26,091
Is it true?

422
00:25:38,737 --> 00:25:44,242
(Ichiro hitting the table with his finger)

423
00:25:44,242 --> 00:25:46,244
Who's on the other side?

424
00:25:46,244 --> 00:25:48,914
Who are you dealing with?
Bring him to me.

425
00:25:48,914 --> 00:25:51,249
I already broke up with her.

426
00:25:54,719 --> 00:25:57,556
We were together, but then we broke up...

427
00:25:58,723 --> 00:26:00,000
So...

428
00:26:00,000 --> 00:26:01,226
So...

429
00:26:01,226 --> 00:26:03,728
I'll give birth to her alone. I'll raise her alone.

430
00:26:05,730 --> 00:26:08,066
You can't do that.
I can't do that!

431
00:26:08,066 --> 00:26:10,068
What?

432
00:26:10,068 --> 00:26:13,071
I don't care if you break up with him or not.
Just go get that guy.

433
00:26:13,071 --> 00:26:15,073
It doesn't matter anymore.
How can it not be relevant?

434
00:26:15,073 --> 00:26:18,577
Dad, please calm down.
How can I be calm?

435
00:26:20,912 --> 00:26:25,083
Do you know how hard it is to have and raise a child?
Do you have any idea how hard it is to have and raise a child?

436
00:26:26,084 --> 00:26:28,587
It's not easy having two parents.

437
00:26:28,587 --> 00:26:30,000
And you're just a kid.

438
00:26:30,000 --> 00:26:31,256
And you're just a kid.

439
00:26:31,256 --> 00:26:33,725
I can't do it alone.
Of course you can't.

440
00:26:33,725 --> 00:26:36,728
Why do you assume it's impossible?

441
00:26:36,728 --> 00:26:41,066
I've already decided.
So, what are you going to do about college?

442
00:26:41,066 --> 00:26:44,069
The university you've worked so hard to get into...

443
00:26:44,069 --> 00:26:46,738
And your dream of becoming a curator.
Are you giving up?

444
00:26:46,738 --> 00:26:48,740
I'm going to college.

445
00:26:48,740 --> 00:26:50,909
I won't give up on my dreams.

446
00:26:50,909 --> 00:26:53,244
Then, unload the child!

447
00:27:05,924 --> 00:27:08,727
That's why I didn't want to...

448
00:27:09,894 --> 00:27:12,397
Tell your father...

449
00:27:17,235 --> 00:27:19,904
My baby

450
00:27:19,904 --> 00:27:22,741
Don't try to kill me on your own.

451
00:27:24,909 --> 00:27:27,412
I know what I'm doing.

452
00:27:27,412 --> 00:27:29,414
You're an idiot.

453
00:27:29,414 --> 00:27:30,000
It's stupid! I know!

454
00:27:30,000 --> 00:27:32,584
It's stupid! I know!

455
00:27:33,585 --> 00:27:35,920
But...

456
00:27:37,088 --> 00:27:39,557
But...

457
00:27:39,557 --> 00:27:43,228
If it had been my mom.
I would never have said that.

458
00:28:05,583 --> 00:28:08,420
Dad, I'm sorry.

459
00:28:08,420 --> 00:28:10,722

Studying to be a curator?

466
00:29:31,569 --> 00:29:33,905
It's costing me money. It's costing me money.
I can't help it.

467
00:29:35,073 --> 00:29:37,408
You really know your stuff.

468
00:29:37,408 --> 00:29:39,577
You're not in the same department?
No, no.

Then buy me a drink.

You even take care of my business.
You're taking care of my business, aren't you?

600
00:36:52,910 --> 00:36:55,913
Would a stranger go that far?

601
00:36:55,913 --> 00:36:58,583
That's true, but...

602
00:36:58,583 --> 00:37:00,000
Maybe... Arisu's baby is what you're after.
Arisu's baby?

603

Maybe... Arisu's baby is what you're after.
Arisu's baby?

What?
I don't know.

605
00:37:06,557 --> 00:37:09,060
When you're 40, your own kids...

606
00:37:09,060 --> 00:37:11,896
I think it might be a little bit difficult.
I think it's a little bit difficult.

607
00:37:11,896 --> 00:37:15,900
Then this single mom shows up.
You take care of her. You owe her.

608
00:37:15,900 --> 00:37:18,903
Eventually, he's going to adopt Arisu's child.
She said she'd adopt him.

609
00:37:18,903 --> 00:37:21,572
Oh, no, no way...

610
00:37:21,572 --> 00:37:24,575
You're not that kind of person, Mr. Naruse.

611
00:37:24,575 --> 00:37:27,745
If Arisu says so.
I'd like to believe you.

612
00:37:27,745 --> 00:37:30,000
But... I'm still worried.

613
00:37:30,000 --> 00:37:30,414
But... I'm still worried.

614
00:37:30,414 --> 00:37:33,251
Because it's definitely not normal.

615
00:37:34,585 --> 00:37:37,722
Then give me that baby.

616
00:37:39,557 --> 00:37:42,560

I don't feel very good about this.

627
00:38:26,237 --> 00:38:28,572
（I'm sorry.
I know we pushed you too hard and...

628
00:38:28,572 --> 00:38:30,000

So you thought you could keep your mouth shut?

642
00:39:40,911 --> 00:39:43,748

Yes, it's inconvenient without a car, isn't it?

667
00:43:10,921 --> 00:43:14,224
When the baby has a sudden fever.

668
00:43:29,073 --> 00:43:30,000

00:45:07,571 --> 00:45:09,907
To the baby
When you talk to her.

697
00:45:09,907 --> 00:45:12,409
I'd rather have a name.
It's better to have a name.

698
00:45:12,409 --> 00:45:14,912
Oh...

699
00:45:14,912 --> 00:45:17,081
What's up?

700
00:45:17,081 --> 00:45:20,250
No... something just now...

701
00:45:20,250 --> 00:45:22,920
I felt it move.

702
00:45:22,920 --> 00:45:24,922
Baby?

703
00:45:24,922 --> 00:45:27,558
Where? Where is it?

704
00:45:27,558 --> 00:45:30,000
Is it my imagination?

705
00:45:30,000 --> 00:45:30,060
Is it my imagination?

706
00:45:31,228 --> 00:45:34,732
But... it moved, right?

707
00:45:34,732 --> 00:45:37,067
Maybe...

708
00:45:38,235 --> 00:45:40,571
You're alive.

709
00:45:41,905 --> 00:45:44,408
You're doing great. You're alive.

710
00:45:45,409 --> 00:45:47,578
Good.

711
00:46:07,731 --> 00:46:10,400
Name...

712
00:46:10,400 --> 00:46:12,402
I've made up my mind.

713
00:46:13,403 --> 00:46:15,572
What?

714
00:46:17,241 --> 00:46:19,243

715
00:46:21,578 --> 00:46:23,747
